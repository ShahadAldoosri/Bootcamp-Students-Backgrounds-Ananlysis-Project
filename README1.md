# Building an Excel Dashboard for Survey Analysis





## Business Requirements
The program management team recently launched a survey to collect student background information. The director and faculty team are interested in understanding the class mix and skill levels. As a data analyst, I was tasked with analyzing the spreadsheet data and creating a simple dashboard. Key information the program director is looking for includes:

The total number of students who completed the survey.
Self-assessment ratings from students on their experiences with Excel, SQL, Python, Tableau, and Power BI.
The level of experience students have with data analytics tools.
Differences observed between the two classes (Class A vs. Class B).
The number of students who are recent graduates.
The educational backgrounds of the students.
The industries and job roles the students are interested in.
The survey results will enable the faculty team to:

Understand students' backgrounds.
Adjust the curriculum based on the class mix.
Provide a better experience tailored to different types of students.
